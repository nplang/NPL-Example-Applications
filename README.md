# NPL Example Applications

Welcome to the NPL Example Aplications. 

We have created example NPL Applications for users to get hands-on experience on the compilation and verification workflow using NPL Front End Compiler and Behavior Model.  Each of these example NPL applications also contains example test files to populate the logical tables using ```BMCLI``` and inject packets to verify the NPL application. These example NPL applicaitons may not be complete from protocol perspective.
